## Solution

In all three scenarios, the variables one, two, and three inside the mess_with_vars function are local to the function. They are not the same as the variables one, two, and three defined outside the function. This is known as variable shadowing, where the local variables inside the function overshadow the variables outside the function with the same names.

A) Since variables one, two, and three in the mess_with_vars function are local, reassigning them does not affect the original lists.

B) Again, the local variables in the mess_with_vars function are being reassigned, but this doesn't change the original lists.

C) In this case, the mess_with_vars function modifies the content of the lists directly. Since lists in Python are mutable and passed by reference, the changes are reflected outside the function.
