## Question

Will the following functions return the same results?

```python
def first():
    return {
        'prop1': "hi there",
    }

def second():
    return
    {
        'prop1': "hi there",
    }

print(first())
print(second())
```

## Answer

No, the `second` function will raise a SyntaxError.

## Solution

These functions do not return the same thing. The function first() returns the expected value of { prop1: "hi there" }, but second() returns None without throwing any errors.

In Python, if there's nothing after a return statement, the function will return None. The indented block after the return statement in second function is unreachable and doesn't affect the return value.

## Reflection

You can have as many return statements as you want, and a SyntaxError will not be raised.
