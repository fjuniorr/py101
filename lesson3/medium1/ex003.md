## Question

## Answer [#incorrect]

No.

```python
def add_to_rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element):
    buffer.append(new_element) # add new element to end of list
    if len(buffer) > max_buffer_size:
        buffer.pop(0) # remove element in beggining of list
    return buffer

def add_to_rolling_buffer2(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element):
    buffer = buffer + [new_element] # add new element to end of list
    if len(buffer) > max_buffer_size:
        buffer.pop(0) # remove element in beggining of list
    return buffer
```

## Solution

### LS

Yes, there is a difference. The first function (add_to_rolling_buffer1) mutates the original list represented by buffer. The second function (add_to_rolling_buffer2) does not mutate the original list, but instead creates a new list and assigns it to buffer, whose value ultimately gets returned by the function.

## Reflection

If you pay attention to small details you take too long but if you do not you could miss details like this.
