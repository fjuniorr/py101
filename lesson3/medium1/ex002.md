## Question

## Answer

Change the loop condition for `divisor > 0` instead of `divisor != 0`

```python
def factors(number):
    divisor = number
    result = []
    while divisor > 0:
        if number % divisor == 0:
            result.append(number // divisor)
        divisor -= 1
    return result

print(factors(72))
print(factors(-10))
```

### Bonus

% is the modulo operator, which returns the rest of the division between number and divisor. By definition if the rest is zero, divisor is a factor of number.

## Solution

### LS

Bonus Answer: It determines whether the result of the division is an integer -- if the number has no remainder, the result is an integer, so the number divided by the divisor is a factor.

## Reflection

- The LS solution is not good.
