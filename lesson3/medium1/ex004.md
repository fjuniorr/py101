## Question

## Answer

```python

```

## Solution

### LS

If you thought that the outputs would be 0.9 and True, respectively, you were wrong. Python uses floating point numbers for all numeric operations. Most floating point representations used on computers lack a certain amount of precision, and that can yield unexpected results like these.

In this case, the output was:

Copy Code
0.8999999999999999
False
The details of why this happens aren't crucial right now -- it's just something you need to be aware of. One way around the problem is to use the math.isclose function:

Copy Code
import math

print(0.3 + 0.6)
print(math.isclose(0.3 + 0.6, 0.9))
Feel free to look at the math.isclose documentation to better understand what is meant by close and for more information on how to use the function.

## Reflection

import decimal

decimal.Decimal(0.3)

x = decimal.Decimal("0.3")
y = decimal.Decimal("0.6")

print(x + y)
print(x + y == decimal.Decimal("0.9"))
