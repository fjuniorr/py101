# Repeat Yourself

## Question

Write a function that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer, then prints the string as many times as the integer indicates.

## Answer

```python
def repeat(string, n):
    """
    Prints string n times
    """
    for _ in range(0, n):
        print(string)

repeat('Hello', 3)
```

## Solution

### LS

```python
def repeat(string, number):
    for _ in range(number):
        print(string)
```

### Users

```python
def repeat(str, num):
    print((str + '\n') * num)
```

## Reflection

With the signature `range(stop)` the body of the loop will execute stop times, so no need to use both `start` and `stop` arguments.

It was a good idea to rewrite the exercise instructions as a docstring with my own words so that I don't tune out while reading the exercise instructions.

This is part of my problem solving process.

Can a python function have two different signatures? Is range implemented as a class so that it can have two signatures?

class range(object)
 |  range(stop) -> range object
 |  range(start, stop[, step]) -> range object
