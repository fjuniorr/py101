## Question

## Answer

```python
def crunch(string) -> str:
    """
    Collapses consecutive duplicated characters from string into single character.
    """
    if not string:
        return string
    
    result = []
    result.append(string[0])
    for char in string[1:]:
        if char != result[-1]:
            result.append(char)
    return "".join(result)

assert crunch("aab") == "ab"
assert crunch('ddaaiillyy ddoouubbllee') == 'daily double'
assert crunch('4444abcabccba') == '4abcabcba'
assert crunch('ggggggggggggggg') == 'g'
assert crunch('abc') == 'abc'
assert crunch('a') == 'a'
assert crunch('') == ''
```

    return re.sub(
                  r"""

#### built-in string and list methods

## Solution

### LS

```python
def crunch(text):
    index = 0
    crunched_text = ''

    while index < len(text):
        if index == len(text) - 1 or text[index] != text[index + 1]:
            crunched_text += text[index]

        index += 1

    return crunched_text
```

### Users

```python
def crunch(text: str):
    crunched = ""
    for char in text:
        if not crunched.endswith(char):
            crunched += char
    return crunched
```

## Reflection

Initially I did not handle the edge case where an empty string is passed as an argument. After seeing the test cases I added a guard clause. Is that a bad idea?

sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)
    Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost
    non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in string by the
    replacement repl.  repl can be either a string or a callable;
    if a string, backslash escapes in it are processed.  If it is
    a callable, it's passed the Match object and must return
    a replacement string to be used.

---

Is using a general variable name such as `result` a better idea then using a name specific to the function such as `crunched`?
