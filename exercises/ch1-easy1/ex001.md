# Isn't it Odd?

## Question

## Answer

```python
def is_odd(n):
    return n % 2 != 0

def test_is_odd():
    assert is_odd(2) == False
    assert is_odd(3) == True
    assert is_odd(-2) == False
```

## Solution

### LS

```python
def is_odd(number):
    return abs(number) % 2 == 1
```

The abs function returns the absolute value of the argument, ensuring it's positive. We then check whether the resulting number modulo 2 equals 1, which would indicate it's odd.

It's actually not necessary to use abs here; when evaluating n % d where n is an integer and d is 1, -1, or 2, it doesn't matter whether n is positive or negative. However, if disn't 1, -1, or 2, it does matter. To make the code as clear as possible, using abs is a good idea.

### Users

## Reflection

Does it matter if I don't take the absolute value? I don't think so.

Indeed it does not matter.

One user wrote that according to his thinking 0 is not even. Therefore he wrote:

```python
if number == 0: 
    return 1
return number % 2
```

He is wrong. In mathematics, zero is an even number. In other words, its parity—the quality of an integer being even or odd—is even. This can be easily verified based on the definition of "even": it is an integer multiple of 2, specifically 0 × 2.
