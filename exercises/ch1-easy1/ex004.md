# How big is the room?

## Question

## Answer

```python
def main(length, width):
    """
    Print a room area in square meters and square feet.

    Args:
        length in meters
        width in meters
    """
    print("Enter the room length (in meters):")
    length = float(input())

    print("Enter the room width (in meters):")
    width = float(input())

    area = length*width
    print(f"Room area (square meters): {area}")
    print(f"Room area (square feet): {area*10.7639}")
```

### Further Exploration (wrong)

```python
def main():
    """
    Print a room area in square meters and square feet.

    Args:
        length
        width
        unit: 'meters' or 'feet'
    """
    print("""==> Choose a unit: (m)eters or (f)eet:""", end="")
    unit = input()
    while True:
        match unit:
            case "m":
                unit = "meters"
                other_unit = "feet"
                conversion_factor = 10.7639
                break
            case "f":
                unit = "feet"
                other_unit = "meters"
                conversion_factor = 1 / 10.7639
                break
            case _:
                print("Enter (m) for meters or (f) for feet.")
                unit = input()

    print(f"==> Enter the room length (in {unit}):", end="")
    length = float(input())

    print(f"==> Enter the room width (in {unit}):", end="")
    width = float(input())

    area = length*width
    print(f"Room area in square {unit}: {area:.2f} ({area*conversion_factor:.2f} square {other_unit})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Solution

### LS

```python
length = float(input("Enter the length of the room in meters: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the room in meters: "))

area_in_meters = length * width
area_in_feet = area_in_meters * 10.7639

print(f"The area of the room is {area_in_meters:.2f} "
      f"square meters ({area_in_feet:.2f} square feet).")
```

## Reflection

- I was insecure about the conversion from meters to feet (but at least got it right)
- The LS solution used a f-string format specification `{:.2f}` that I don't use often
- I wrote an infinite `while` loop for collecting the loop because I forgot to ask for the unit inside the match case
- Distinct prompt interface from results
