# Greeting a user

## Question

Write a program that asks for user's name, then greets the user. If the user appends a ! to their name, the computer will yell the greeting (print it using all uppercase).

## Answer

```python
def main(name):
    """
    Greets the user.

    If user appends ! to name, screen.
    """
    if name.endswith("!"):
        return f"HELLO {name.upper()} WHY ARE WE YELLING?"
    else:
        return f"Hello {name}."

assert main("Sue") == "Hello Sue."
assert main("Bob!") == "HELLO BOB! WHY ARE WE YELLING?"
```

## Solution

### LS

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")

if name.endswith("!"):
    print(f"HELLO {name.upper()} WHY ARE WE YELLING?")
else:
    print(f"Hello {name}.")
```

### Users

My solution was pretty similar to LS's and some other's below, but I added the str.title() method to ensure the name is printed titlecased if no "!"'s.

```python
name = input("What is your name?: ")

def greeting(name):
    if name[-1] == '!':
        return f'HELLO {name.upper()} WHY ARE WE SO EXCITED?!' 
    else:
        return f'Hello {name.title()}.'

print(greeting(name))
```

## Reflection

I used endswith and not in to make sure that only ! appended to the string are correcly greeted with a yelling.

Forgot to call `name.upper()` in the first if block.
