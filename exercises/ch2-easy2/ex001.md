## Question

Create a function that takes 2 arguments, a list and a dictionary. The list will contain 2 or more elements that, when joined with spaces, will produce a person's name. The dictionary will contain two keys, "title" and "occupation", and the appropriate values. Your function should return a greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title.

## Answer

```python
def greetings(names, job):
    full_name = " ".join(names)
    title = job["title"]
    occupation = job["occupation"]
    return f"Hello, {full_name}! Nice to have a {title} {occupation} around."

greeting = greetings(
    ["John", "Q", "Doe"],
    {"title": "Master", "occupation": "Plumber"},
)

assert greeting == "Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around."
